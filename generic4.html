							<h2>Ivy Tech Community College</h2>
							<p><strong>Cybersecurity and Artificial Intelligence (Mar 2024 - Feb 2025)</strong></p>
							<p>At Ivy Tech, I have completed foundational courses in Cybersecurity, including the <strong>CompTIA A+</strong> certification and the <strong>Cisco CyberOps</strong> program. These courses provided me with a deep understanding of cybersecurity tools, network troubleshooting, and the OSI model. I have gained hands-on experience in areas such as Powershell scripting, artificial intelligence (AI), and software-defined networking (SDN). Currently, I am advancing my programming skills through the <strong>Python Programming</strong> course, where I am learning Python syntax, libraries, and application development. I am also expanding my knowledge in machine learning fundamentals, which helps me understand and apply AI concepts in real-world scenarios.</p>
							<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Cybersecurity Tools, Powershell, Network Troubleshooting, OSI Model, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Organization Skills, Software Defined Networking (SDN), Python (Programming Language), Machine Learning, Wide Area Network (WAN), Network Automation.</p>

							<h2>Institute for Veterans and Military Families (IVMF)</h2>
							<p><strong>Cisco Networking (Jan 2024 - Jun 2024)</strong></p>
							<p>As part of the Onward 2 Opportunity program, I gained extensive hands-on experience with Cisco routers, networking protocols, and technologies essential for securing and optimizing enterprise networks. The coursework covered critical topics such as <strong>OSI Model</strong>, <strong>IPv4</strong> and <strong>IPv6</strong> configurations, <strong>VLAN</strong> implementation, <strong>Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)</strong> routing, <strong>subnetting</strong>, and <strong>network trunking</strong>. This experience has provided me with a solid foundation in networking and cybersecurity, which I am eager to apply in real-world networking environments to improve system reliability and security.</p>
							<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Cisco Routers, Cybersecurity Tools, OSI Model, IPv4, Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), VLAN, Organization Skills, Trunking, IPv6, Subnetting, Wide Area Network (WAN), Network Security, Routing Protocols.</p>

							<h2>University of Central Arkansas</h2>
							<p><strong>Bachelor of Arts in Psychology (May 2021) - GPA: 3.25</strong></p>
							<p>At the University of Central Arkansas, I not only developed strong research and analytical skills but also honed my leadership and interpersonal abilities as part of the <strong>Army Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC)</strong>. My involvement in the Psychological Society as Research Chair enabled me to lead research projects and collaborate with professionals to analyze human behavior and its impact on organizations. Through my experiences in ROTC, I developed a strong foundation in leadership, team management, and problem-solving—skills that are crucial in both military and civilian environments. My background in psychology has made me adept at understanding human dynamics, improving customer service, and adapting to various work environments, all of which I bring to my career in IT and cybersecurity.</p>
